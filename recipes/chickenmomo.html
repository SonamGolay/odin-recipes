            To bring more flavour, you can also add some garlic and onion paste. As soon as the chicken boils, transfer it to a bowl and shred it into fine pieces.</li></p>
        
            <p><li>When preparing the dough in the chicken momo recipe, add the refined oil in the flour and mix it with salt. 
                Add water and make a smooth dough. Make sure that you do not make any lumps while forming the dough. Meanwhile, 
                leave the dough aside and bring the main course. Mix all the vegetables with the shredded chicken. Add the soy sauce and see how the colour changes.
                 Stir the mixture well. Take the dough and roll it into balls.</li></p>
        
            <p><li>Now flatten the balls and add the chicken veggie mixture in the centre. 
                Overlap the edges of the dough and secure it to make a momo. Repeat the same with other balls. 
                Further, put the chicken momo in a steamer and leave it for 20 minutes. 
                Once the momo turns tender, scoop it up into a platter and serve it with spicy chutney. Now your chicken momo is ready to be eaten. </li></p>
