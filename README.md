# odin-recipes
The aim of this project is to build a basic recipe website with some of my favourite recipes.
The odin recipe website has been completed. I have learnt how to construct a basic html webpage with the practice of using many HTML elements. 
The website consists of the homepage which lists the 3 best recipes. Each recipe has been put in an unordered list and linked respectively to their seperate recipe webpage. 
The recipe webpages of the 3 recipes decribes what the dish is, the required ingredients and the cooking instructions.
